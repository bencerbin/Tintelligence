    <h1>Project Proposal: Developing a Neural Network to Colorize Black/White Photos and Videos</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pertaining to old images, we would like to help them look more realistic by adding color. This would be useful in history classes and programs, or artistic projects.</li>
        <li>Along with containing millions of pixels per image, converting black and white photos to color would rely on predicting changes in RGB values based on extremely fine differences in grayscale values.</li>
        <li>Many modern colorizers suffer from a rather pale and dull color scheme; by training our data not only on what the image looked like but what it <em>should</em> look like to account for stylistic choices allows for more latitude in portrayal.</li>
        <li>Technical challenges we foresee would concern the accuracy of color prediction.</li>
        <li>Anticipating a successfully built black-and-white colorizer, our project suggests that black-and-white colorization that accounts for stylistic choices is possible with limited resources.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Ethical Sweep</h2>
    <p>We will obtain all training data from public open sources such as Getty stock photos and similar platforms. Additionally, we will create our own data by capturing videos and converting them into black-and-white to reverse-engineer. This approach will help diversify our dataset and enhance its quality.</p>
    
    <p>We will carefully curate the data to ensure it represents a wide range of subjects and scenarios, to avoid the bias of a specific group being overrepresented. Maintaining a diverse sample is crucial to preventing biases in our training data.</p>
    
    <p>Through these efforts, we aim to build a more accurate and fair model. We are a diverse team and will make a conscientious effort to represent diverse groups. We believe that this project is worthwhile to bring to life historical photos and videos for better appreciation. Converting black-and-white media into color has required painstaking colorization by hand in the past. This solution will be much more efficient, leveraging the power of tech.</p>
