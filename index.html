    <h1>Project Description:</h1>
    <p>I'm planning on using weather data to predict avalanche risk based on slope aspect, elevation, 
    steepness, snow depth, and forecasted stability. With this prediction, I'd build an application 
    that takes a topographical map and overlays a visualization of this avalanche risk. </p>
    
    <p>While this project is inspired by my favorite hobby (backcountry skiing), highway and railroad
    Companies would benefit the most from it. In rural mountain areas, avalanches threaten the safety
    of workers, and can cut off access to small towns. These areas, moreover, don't have the luxury 
    of having avalanche forecasters be able to go out and examine the snowpackâ€”thus, they need an an 
    alternate solution like this one. </p>

    <p>Realistically, this is not something that backcountry recreators should be using. The margin 
    for error in these settings is far smaller, and the decision-making necessary to stay safe is more
    nuanced. </p>

    <p>Success in this project looks like when we can give a decently confident prediction as to which
    aspects and elevations will be most prone to avalanches. </p>

    <h2>Goals (in order of priority, because this could be really hard!)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Based on the winter's weather data, predict overall avalanche danger. </li>
        <li>Predict avalanche-prone aspects, and how unstable they are.</li>
        <li>Within the aspects, predict which elevations are most avalanche-prone</li>
        <li>Take this data, and build an map overlay to visualize findings. </li>
    </ol>
